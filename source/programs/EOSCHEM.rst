:grey:`Blue/gray nodes` are required courses in the program. Other required courses with options are separated into individually colored clusters and labeled by the number of required courses from that cluster. Extra required electives are not part of the graph. White nodes are pre-req options that are not explicitly required in the program.


Pre-requisites are depicted using directional edges with an arrow that point in the direction of the course that has the pre-requisite. The color of the edge is black if the pre-req is always required. The edge is colored if there is a set of pre-req courses. The color will be  :red:`red` if the requirement is 1 of the set, :blue:`blue` if the requirement is 2 of the set, and :green:`green` if the requirement is 3 of the set. Different edge patterns, such as solid vs dashed, represent unique sets. For example, a course may have two sets of pre-reqs where only 1 course is required from each. In this example, both sets would have :red:`red` lines and one would be solid while the other is dashed.
